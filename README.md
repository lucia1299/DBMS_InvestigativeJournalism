This is the Github repository of the project "Data Management in Investigative Journalism: An Exploratory Task on AI tools for Italian Newsrooms". The project was developed as a Graduation task for the Master Degree in Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge (University of Bologna)

ABSTRACT
This project is an exploratory task on using semantic and AI driven technologies for journalistic purposes in the context of Italian newsrooms. The main research question that the project aims to answer is how could AI tools be used for data management in Italian journalism. Within this scope, the focus will be on knowledge graphs and graph databases as possible storing mechanisms for information and data that the newsroom handles. The idea of this project stems from the possibilities that AI-driven technologies open in the journalism industry, specifically when it comes to investigative tasks. The final outcome is the creation of the News Organiser, a database system for storing and querying entities and relations extracted from the articles and the documents of a given newsroom. The implementation of this database is studied while considering the following aspects: the feasibility of an hybrid system between LLMs and task-specific models, the availability of open source tools, the independence from proprietary solutions, and the ethics of AI usage.
